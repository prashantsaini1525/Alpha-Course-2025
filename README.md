<!-- IN JAVA IF YOU WANT TO RUN CODE IN TERMINAL YOU HAVE TO ENTER THE FOLDER WHERE YOU PUT THE CODE.
AND THEN IF YOU WANT TO BACK TO ONE FOLDER OR PARENT FOLDER YOU HAVE TO WRITE IN TERMINAL "cd.." and likwise. -->

<!-- IF YOU WANT TO GO HOME DIRECTORY SIMPLY WRITE "cd ~" AND IF YOU WANT TO GO THE LAST FOLDER YOU WERE IN YOU HAVE TO WRITE "cd -" -->
