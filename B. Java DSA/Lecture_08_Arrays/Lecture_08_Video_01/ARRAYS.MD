## What Are Arrays?

An **array** is a data structure that stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. Think of an array like a row of lockers: each locker holds one item (or value) and is identified by its position (index) in the row.

- **Fixed size:** Once created, the size of an array cannot change.
- **Same type:** All elements in an array must be of the same data type (e.g., integers, strings).

## Why Use Arrays?

Arrays are used because they:

- **Store Multiple Values:** Instead of having many separate variables, you can store a series of related values in one array.
- **Easy Access:** Elements can be accessed quickly using their index (position in the array).
- **Efficient:** Arrays offer efficient memory usage when you know how many elements you need to store.

## Declaring and Initializing Arrays

### Declaring an Array

To declare an array in Java, specify the type of elements and the array's name:

<!-- ```java -->
```bash
int[] numbers;
```

### Creating an Array

After declaring, create the array using the new keyword and specify its size:

<!-- ```java -->
```bash
numbers = new int[5];  // Creates an array of 5 integers
```

You can combine both steps:

<!-- ```java -->
```bash
int[] numbers = new int[5];
```

### Initializing an Array with Values

You can also declare and initialize an array in one line:

<!-- ```java -->
```bash
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```
## Accessing Array Elements

Each element in an array is accessed using its index. Remember, array indices start at 0.

- First element: numbers[0]
- Second element: numbers[1]
- Last element (if array length is 5): numbers[4]

### Example: Printing All Elements

<!-- ```java -->
```bash
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    System.out.println("Element at index " + i + ": " + numbers[i]);
}
```

## Common Operations on Arrays

Here are some basic operations you can perform on arrays:

- 1. **Traversing an Array:** Loop through each element to process or display it.
- 2. **Searching:** Find an element by checking each value (e.g., using a linear search).
- 3. **Modifying Elements:** Update the value at a specific index.
- 4. **Sorting:** Arrange elements in a specific order (e.g., ascending or descending).

## Practice Exercises

Try these exercises to reinforce your learning:

1. **Print Array:** Write a program to print all elements of an array.
2. **Find Maximum:** Write a method to find the maximum value in an array.
3. **Sum of Elements:** Write a program that calculates the sum of all numbers in an array.
4. **Linear Search:** Implement a linear search to find the index of a specific value.
