Ques.1: What is FirstTypePromotion?

Ans : 
FirstTypePromotion is a feature in Java that allows automatic type conversion between different data types. When a lower data type is assigned a value that can be represented by a higher data type, the lower data type is automatically promoted to the higher data type. This process is known as type promotion.

(Easy Conclusion : byte,short, character which is also called short Data Types are convert into int data type.)

Ques.2:what is second type promotion?

Ans: Second type promotion in Java is the automatic conversion of smaller data types to larger ones during the execution of an arithmetic operation. This is done to maintain the precision and accuracy of the result. In the given code snippet, the variables a, b, c, and d are of different data types (int, float, long, and double respectively). When these variables are added together, the result is automatically promoted to the largest data type (double) to ensure that no precision is lost. This is an example of second type promotion in Java.

(Easy Conclusion : long,float,double which are "big or long data types" are convert into which data type have big value convert into that data type.(matlab ki jis data types ki value sabhse bdie hoti hai usme hi convert ho jayega ab woh oi bhi data type ho skata hai ex: long,float,double))
