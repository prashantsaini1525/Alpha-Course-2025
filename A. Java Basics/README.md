AND THEN IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO ONE FOLDER OR PARENT FOLDER YOU HAVE TO WRITE "cd.." in the terminal. -->

<!-- IF YOU WANT TO GO TO THE HOME DIRECTORY SIMPLY WRITE "cd ~" AND IF YOU WANT TO GO TO THE LAST FOLDER YOU WERE IN YOU HAVE TO WRITE "cd -" -->

## Introduction

This repository is designed for beginners who are new to Java. Each lecture is carefully structured to provide:

- **Concept Explanations:** Detailed descriptions of the topics.
- **Code Examples:** Practical examples to illustrate each concept.
- **Practice Questions:** Exercises to reinforce your understanding.

Once you master these fundamentals, you'll be well-prepared to dive into Data Structures & Algorithms.

## Java Basics Overview

Java is a widely used, object-oriented programming language known for its portability and ease of use. In this section, you'll learn:

- **Basic Syntax & Structure:** How to write, compile, and run Java programs.
- **Variables & Data Types:** Understanding how data is stored and manipulated.
- **Operators:** Performing arithmetic, logical, and relational operations.
- **Control Flow:** Using conditional statements and loops to control the execution of your code.
- **Methods & Functions:** Creating reusable blocks of code.
- **Patterns & Problem-Solving:** Applying loops and conditional logic to solve common programming challenges.

This foundation is essential for any aspiring Java developer and will serve as a stepping stone for more complex topics later in the course.
