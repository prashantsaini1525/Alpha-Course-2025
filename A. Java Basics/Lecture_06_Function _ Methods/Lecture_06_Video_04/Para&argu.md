# Parameters and Arguments in Java

Understanding the difference between **parameters** and **arguments** is essential for working with methods in Java. Both are used in the context of methods, but they serve different purposes.

---

## What Are Parameters?

- **Parameters** are variables defined in the method declaration.
- They act as placeholders for the values that will be passed to the method when it is called.
- Parameters specify the type and number of inputs the method expects.

### Example: Method with Parameters

```java
public class Example {
    // 'a' and 'b' are parameters.
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

# Key Differences Between Parameters and Arguments

| **Aspect**           | **Parameter**                                                | **Argument**                                              |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**       | A variable in the method signature.                          | The actual value passed to the method during a call.      |
| **Location**         | Declared in the method definition.                           | Specified in the method call.                             |
| **Purpose**          | To define what type of data the method expects.              | To provide the actual data for the method to process.     |
| **Example in Code**  | `public int add(int a, int b)`                                | `example.add(5, 3)`                                       |

By understanding these key differences, you can write better Java programs and use methods effectively.
